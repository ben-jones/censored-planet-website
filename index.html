          <h2>What is Censored Planet?</h2>

	  <p>
	    Censored Planet’s goals are to discover what governments
	    censor, how they restrict access, and how decisions about
	    censorship vary across regions, countries, and
	    time. Existing approaches cannot perform censorship
	    measurements at a sufficient scale to answer these
	    questions; worse, users must perform these measurements
	    on-site, putting people at risk. We avoid these problems
	    by building Censored Planet on top of advance network
	    inference channels that allow researchers to measure
	    connectivity between arbitrary endpoints, which satisfy
	    certain basic requirements, from almost anywhere. By using
	    these network inference channels such as idle scans, that
	    don’t require any access to any of the machines that
	    connectivity is tested to or from, we can shed light on
	    entirely unexplored areas of the Internet. Our framework
	    makes significant contributions to the current state of
	    Internet censorship detection by trying to solve the
	    following challenges: <br />

	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>Broad coverage from many representative vantage
		  points. </b> We could not rely on deploying dedi-
		  cated measurement agents, nor could we rely on
		  recruitment of individual activist users, neither of
		  which provide scale or broad coverage. In contrast
		  to previous studies, we seek to perform measurements
		  of censorship from as many vantage points as
		  possible that don’t belong to any end users
		  (e.g. routers). </li>

	      <li><b>Cross-layer measurements</b>. Censors often
		change the methods that they use to implement
		censorship, so studying filtering at multiple layers
		of the protocol stack is important. We focus on
		TCP/IP, DNS-based filtering and Http layer, which lie
		at the foundation of Internet connectivity and are
		three common protocols that governments use to
		implement censorship. </li>

	      <li><b>Coordinated snapshots</b>. Many political
		scientists want to study how censorship varies across
		regions within a country or across countries. As a
		result, we need better ways to conduct measurements to
		the same set of destinations from different vantage
		points within roughly the same time period. Doing so
		requires designing fast, lightweight measurement
		techniques that still yield accurate information.</li>

	      <li><b>Minimal (or zero) risk to citizens</b>. Measuring
		Internet censorship carries an existential risk for
		citizens. Although we are not aware of any country
		where measuring censorship is explicitly illegal,
		measuring censorship may still subject a citizen to
		unknown existential risks (e.g., increased
		surveillance).  Thus we measure only from
		infrastructure vantage points, which helps to preclude
		any links between our measurements and users</li>

	  <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
	  <p>
	    We want to involve a self-motivated student to help us
	    with our Censored Planet project. We are a group of
	    academics who have experience with successfully mentoring
	    students over the past years. This year, we are hoping to
	    involve a highly motivated coder with a strong web
	    development background.
	  </p>

	<p class="front">
	  Working for this project is rewarding for many reasons:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Being involved in a project that matters to humanity
	      because we expose violations of free speech. This
	      project will help the public understand the alarming
	      influence of governments’ agendas in blocking
	      information in different parts of the world.
	    </li>
	    <li>Working with and analyzing large amounts of data. In
	      many future projects, you might need skills to deal with
	      big data. We have a great deal of experience in working
	      with such datasets.
	    </li>
	    <li> Getting a feeling for interdisciplinary
	      research. Internet censorship does not just concern
	      computer science and researchers from many different
	      fields are working on it. In addition to software
	      development, you will get a feeling for
	      interdisciplinary research in general and for this field
	      in particular.
	    </li>
	  </ul> &nbsp; </p>
